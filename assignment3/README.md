# ENSF 400 - Assignment 3 - Kubernetes

This assignment has a full mark of 100. It takes up 5\% of your final grade. 

You will use Minikube in Codespaces to deploy an nginx service an 2 backend apps.

## Requirements

Based on your work for [Lab 7](https://github.com/denoslab/ensf400-lab7-kubernetes-1) and [Lab 8](https://github.com/denoslab/ensf400-lab8-kubernetes-2), deploy an `nginx` service so that:

1. A `Deployment` config defined in `nginx-dep.yaml`. The Deployment has the name `nginx-dep` with 5 replicas. The Deployment uses a base image `nginx` with the version tag `1.14.2`. Expose port `80`.
1. A `ConfigMap` defined in `nginx-configmap.yaml`, The `data` in the configmap has a key-value pair with the key being `nginx.cfg` and value being the following:
```
upstream backend {
    server app-1:8080;
    server app-2:8080;
}

server {
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend;
    }
}
```
1. In the Deployment `nginx-dep`, mount the configuration file `default.conf` to the correct path of `/etc/nginx/conf.d` so that it serves as a load balancer, similar to what we have for [Assignment 2](https://github.com/denoslab/ensf400-lab5-ansible/tree/main/assignment2).
1. A `Service` config of type `ClusterIP` defined in `nginx-svc.yaml`. The service has the name `nginx-svc`, exposes port `80`, and should use label selectors to select the pods from the `Deployment` defined in the last step.
1. An `Ingress` config named `nginx-ingress.yaml` redirecting the requests to path `/` to the backend service `nginx-svc`. Example request and response:
```bash
$ curl http://$(minikube ip)/
Hello World from [app-1-dep-86f67f4f87-2d28z]!
$ curl http://$(minikube ip)/
Hello World from [app-2-dep-7f686c4d8d-lr95c]!
```
1. Write `Deployment` and `Service` for `app-1` and `app-2`, respectively.
1. Define two other `Ingress` configs named `app-1-ingress.yaml` and `app-2-ingress.yaml`, both redicting requests to `/app` to the backend apps, taking `app-1` as the main deployment, and `app-2` as a canary deployment. The ingresses will redirect 70% of the traffic to `app-1` and 30% of the traffic to `app-2`. The docker images are pre-built for you. They can be downloaded using the URL below:
```
app-1: ghcr.io/denoslab/ensf400-sample-app:v1
app-2: ghcr.io/denoslab/ensf400-sample-app:v2
```

## Deliverables

1. (10%) `nginx-dep.yaml`
1. (10%) `nginx-configmap.yaml`
1. (10%) `nginx-svc.yaml`
1. (20%) `nginx-ingress.yaml`. Include steps showing the requests using `curl` and responses from load-balanced app backends (`app-1` and `app-2`).
1. (15%) `app-1-dep.yaml`, `app-1-svc.yaml`, `app-2-dep.yaml`, `app-2-svc.yaml`.
1. (20%) `app-1-ingress.yaml` and `app-2-ingress.yaml`.
1. (15%) A `README.md` Markdown file describing the steps and outputs meeting the requirements.
